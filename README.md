# Disclaimer
This repo is still in beta.  The backend server should work, but there is not a client yet.  The Flutter app is a work in progress.

## Overview
The objective of this repo is to demonstrate the ability to consume bi-directional communication in a Flutter app using gRPC as the communication protocol.  It will also demonstrate an approach for implementing a broadcast backplane within the server implementation.

For this repo, we will build a chat application as features of a chat app require the type of design that the repo intends to demonstrate (i.e., bi-directional communication with broadcast).
